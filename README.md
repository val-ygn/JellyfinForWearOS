# JellyfinForWearOS
Please note that this description is in 2 Parts.

## PART 1: Key Information (General Public)
This section is designed to present the project in a clear and accessible way for everyone.

### 1.1 Introduction to the Concept
Jellyfin for WearOS is an innovative solution for Jellyfin media server users who own a WearOS smartwatch (version 3.0 and above). Today, our watches have become independent companions. The goal of this app is to free users from the need to carry their smartphones while enjoying their personal library of music and audiobooks.

### 1.2 Key Features
The app does more than just stream audio; it offers a complete experience tailored for the wrist:

Total Freedom (Streaming & Offline): Whether you are connected to your home Wi-Fi or in the middle of a forest without a signal, your music remains accessible. The "Download" mode allows you to store your favorite tracks directly in the watch's memory.

Audiobook Specialization: Unlike standard music players, this app remembers exactly where you left off in your audiobook, allowing you to resume listening instantly.

Simplified Ecosystem: Thanks to the smartphone companion app, the initial setup—which is often a hassle on a watch (typing URLs, passwords)—becomes child's play.

### 1.3 Daily User Experience
Imagine your routine:

Morning: You open the app on your watch. With a quick glance at the "Tile" on your watch face, you can see your recommended albums.

During Exercise: You leave your phone at home. Your Bluetooth headphones are connected directly to your watch. You launch your "Running" playlist, downloaded the night before.

Evening: You pick up your audiobook where you left off. With a simple gesture on the screen, you can skip back 30 seconds to replay an important passage.

### 1.4 Why is this app necessary?
Currently, there are very few high-quality options for accessing a Jellyfin server on WearOS. This project fills a technological gap by offering a modern, dark interface (to save battery on OLED screens) that is intuitive, respects Jellyfin’s visual identity, and is fully optimized for small circular displays.
